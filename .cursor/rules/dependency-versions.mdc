Always use the latest available versions of dependencies when adding or updating them. If compatibility issues or errors arise due to a new dependency version, update your codebase to be compatible with the latest version rather than downgrading the dependency. Do not pin dependencies to older versions to avoid code changes; prioritize keeping dependencies up to date and refactor code as needed to maintain compatibility.
